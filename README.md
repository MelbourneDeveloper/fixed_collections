# fixed_collections

This library contains fixed (immutable/unmodifiable) collections. You pass an iterable into the constructor and get a list you cannot modify. More importantly, all the members that modify the list are deprecated, so you get a warning or error at compile time. Use this library with the `deprecated_member_use_from_same_package` [code [analysis](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options) option.

More fixed collections are coming!

Please report non-deprecated members that modify the collection in the issues section
