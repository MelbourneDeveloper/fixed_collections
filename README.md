# fixed_collections

This library contains collections that are fixed (immutable/unmodifiable). You pass an iterable in to the constructor and you get a list that you cannot modify. More importantly, all the members that modify the list are deprecated so you get a warning or error at compile time. Use this library with the `deprecated_member_use_from_same_package` [code analysis](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options) option on.

More fixed collections coming!

Please report members that modify the collection and are not deprecated in the issues section
